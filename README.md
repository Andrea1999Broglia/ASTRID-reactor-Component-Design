# Introduction

The	goal of	this project was to perform the preliminary design of a fuel pin	for	a sodium-cooled fast reactor.
In particular, it was asked to:
*   The	thickness	of	the	cladding,
*   The	size	of	the	fuel-cladding	gap,
*   The	height	of	the	plenum.

Based	 on	 the	 sizing	 step,	 it was 	 asked	 to	 verify the	 preliminary	 pin	 design	
proposed	in	terms	of:
*   Temperature of	the	cladding,
*   Yielding of	the	cladding,
*   Thermal	creep of	the	cladding,
*   Margin to	melting of	the	fuel.

The	core	design	specifications	of	this	Sodium-cooled	Fast	Reactor	(SFR)	are	given	in	
Table 1.

The	reactor	core	is	composed	of wrapped	hexagonal	Fuel	Assemblies	(FAs),	
each	 one	 containing	 217	 fuel	 pins	 arranged	 in	 a	 triangular	 lattice.	 The	 FAs	 are	
subdivided	into	two	radial	zones	of	the	core,	and surrounded	by	two	rows	of reflector
and	neutron-shielding	elements	(Figure	1).

The fuel	 pin	 concept	 is	 based	 on	 an	 axially	 heterogeneous	 fuel	 column	 (i.e.,	 active	
column	composed	by	 fertile	and	 fissile	axial	zones),	with annular	 fissile	pellets while	
full	 fertile	pellets (Figure	1).

The	 fuel	is	made	 of	U-Pu	mixed	 oxides	(MOX)	for	what	concerns	the	fissile	pellets	(initial	Pu	content	of	23	at.%	over	heavy	metal atoms),	while	the	fertile	pellets	are	made	of	uranium	dioxide (UO2,	natural	U).	The	cladding material	
is	an	austenitic stainless steel 15-15Ti	(15%	Cr,	15%	Ni,	0.45%	Ti). The	initial	filling	gas	
in	the	fuel-cladding	gap	is	100%	helium.	Detailed	compositions	of	fuel	and	cladding	are	
provided	in	Table	2.	


The	irradiation	scenario	consists	in	a	normal	operation	at	the	reactor	power	of	1500	
MWth.

The	fuel	residence	time	in-reactor	is	of	1440	EFPD	(Equivalent	Full	Power	Days),	
divided	in	four	cycles	of	360	EFPD	each,	with	a	progressive	decrease	by	10%	of	the	pin	
linear	power	during	irradiation.	

The	maximum	linear	heat	rate	of	qâ€™	=	46.3	kW	m-1 (hot	
pin,	hot	channel)	occurs	at	the	beginning	of	irradiation	(i.e.,	after	the	first	power	rise	at	
reactor	start-up).	The	axial	peak	factors	defining	the	axial	profile	of	the	pin	linear	power
and	neutron	flux,	assumed	constant	along	irradiation	and	equal	for	the	average	and	the	
hot	channel,	are	provided	in	Table	3.


Some correlations	for	the	properties	of	the	fuel,	cladding	and	coolant	are	provided	along the	
discussion.	The	equivalent	stress	leading	 to	thermal	creep	 failure	is	plotted	in	Figure	2
against	the	Larson-Miller	parameter	(LMP),	for	the	considered	cladding	steel.
The	 fuel	 pin	 design	 limits, to	 be	 respected	 under	 normal	 operation irradiation	
conditions,	are	collected	in	Table	5.
