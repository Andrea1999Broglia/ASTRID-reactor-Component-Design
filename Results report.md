# Results report
It is useful to remember that the aim of this preliminary analysis was the design of:
*   the	thickness	of	the	cladding,
*   the	size	of	the	fuel-cladding	gap,
*   the	height	of	the	plena,

while the boundaries to be osserved were the:
*   temperature of	the	cladding,
*   yielding of	the	cladding,
*   creep strain of	the	cladding,
*   margin to	melting of	the	fuel.

**Thickness of the cladding**

First of all, a thickness of the cladding was proposed and *a posteriori* verified. To do so, the axial temperature profile under different approaches.
